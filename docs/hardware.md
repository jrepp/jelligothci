# ESP32 toolchain and hardware

## Repository-local ESP32 toolchain

The supported bootstrap workflow runs on macOS and Linux (or Linux under WSL).
It needs Git, Bash, Python 3.10–3.13 with venv support, and standard platform
build prerequisites. On macOS install Xcode command-line tools; on Linux use
the prerequisites in [Espressif's setup guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5/esp32s3/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html).
Python 3.14 is intentionally not selected by the wrapper.
ESP-IDF requires the checkout path to contain no whitespace.

```sh
make esp-bootstrap             # download SDK + compiler + isolated Python tools
./scripts/esp doctor           # versions and serial port detection
make esp-build
./scripts/esp ports
make esp-flash PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodem101
make esp-monitor PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodem101
# Linux ports usually look like /dev/ttyACM0. Exit monitor with Ctrl+].
```

`scripts/esp` resolves paths from its own location, so it works from other
directories and does not require sourcing an environment or changing shell
profiles. Set `JELLI_PYTHON=/path/to/python3.13` to select a bootstrap interpreter.
The wrapper verifies that the SDK tag resolves to the tracked commit before
using it. It refuses to sync over edits to tracked SDK files.

| Tracked configuration | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `toolchain.env` | Exact ESP-IDF release and commit |
| `ports/esp32/main/idf_component.yml` | Direct BSP and LVGL version pins |
| `ports/esp32/dependencies.lock` | Resolved component dependency versions |
| `ports/esp32/sdkconfig.defaults` | ESP32-S3, 16 MB flash, octal PSRAM, USB serial |

SDK sources live in `.tools/esp-idf`; compilers and the Python environment live
in `.tools/espressif`. Caches also live under `.tools`. Build output is under
`build/esp32`, downloaded components under `ports/esp32/managed_components`.
These directories and the generated `sdkconfig` are ignored by Git. They can
be recreated from tracked configuration. The first bootstrap downloads a
substantial SDK/toolchain and requires network access. Normal builds use the
local installation after dependencies have been fetched.

### Syncing and upgrading

`make esp-sync` restores the **tracked pin**, including submodules and tools;
it does not silently select the newest release. To upgrade ESP-IDF, change
both `JELLI_IDF_VERSION` and `JELLI_IDF_COMMIT` in `toolchain.env` to a matching
release tag and resolved commit, then run `make esp-sync` and `make esp-build`.
Keep the component manifest's IDF constraint consistent if changing release
series. Test the firmware before committing updated pins.

To upgrade board components, edit their exact versions in `idf_component.yml`,
run `./scripts/esp idf update-dependencies`, then build and commit the resulting
`dependencies.lock`. Never commit `.tools` or `managed_components`.

For configuration changes use `./scripts/esp idf menuconfig`; put intentional
changes in `sdkconfig.defaults`. Defaults seed a fresh configuration and do not
override an existing generated `sdkconfig`. Remove the ignored generated config
and rebuild when intentionally resetting to defaults. Local virtual environments
and CMake caches contain absolute paths: bootstrap and rebuild after moving a
checkout; the workflow is portable, its downloaded binaries/caches are not.


## Hardware bring-up

The ESP32 port uses Waveshare's BSP for this exact board, including its touch
orientation and panel initialization. It is not the similarly named 1.75C board.
The app sets 60% display brightness. SDL targets an 8 ms update interval; ESP32
targets 16 ms for its engine loop and LVGL refresh timer. The ESP32 loop includes
render/presentation work in that interval and yields on overruns. Actual update
rates are logged every five seconds and are not panel-refresh guarantees.
Firmware uses performance compiler optimization with assertions retained.
The earlier shapes firmware measured 61–62 engine updates/second on the attached
board during motion; this is not a panel FPS or touch-latency measurement. See
[memo-006](../docs-cms/memos/memo-006-input-animation-and-frame-performance.md).

Flashing replaces the existing application and partition table. Preserve any
factory firmware you want to keep before the first flash. If automatic download
mode fails, use the board's documented BOOT/reset sequence, check the enumerated
port again, and retry. USB detection alone does not validate display or touch.

Current firmware bring-up checks: confirm the pet and legible menu appear,
buttons match touch coordinates, care completes, Rest/Wake changes the pose,
and the display survives reset. The pet simulation's sleep state does not put
the board into hardware sleep. Firmware checkpoints to NVS and reads the board RTC
after an explicit debug clock sync. Unknown or backward time grants no offline
progress. Hardware sleep, battery charging, RTC battery retention, and physical
interaction remain unverified.

The current pet/debug firmware has been flashed successfully; serial startup
verified PSRAM, display/touch driver initialization, and both ready messages.
Physical appearance and touch response remain unverified. See the
[deployment record](../docs-cms/memos/memo-010-pet-and-debug-firmware-deployment.md). Earlier shapes firmware was flashed and
reached its ready message; that evidence does not validate the new pet UI. See
the [USB deployment record](../docs-cms/memos/memo-003-first-usb-deployment.md) and
[current MVP validation](../docs-cms/memos/memo-008-playable-pet-mvp-and-polish-backlog.md).
