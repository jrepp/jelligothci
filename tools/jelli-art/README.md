# Jelli Art

Browser pixel editor and before/after review for the slice artwork. Artist
instructions: [Paint in Jelli Art](../../docs/artwork.md#paint-in-jelli-art).
Style rules: [pixel art guide](../../docs/pixel-art-guide.md).

## Run locally

```sh
make jelli-art                      # http://127.0.0.1:8765/, edits this checkout
./scripts/uv run --python 3.12 tools/jelli-art/jelli_art.py --help
```

Local runs only write PNGs, `assets.json` bounds and `clips`,
`source/hand-painted.json`, and `content/creatures.json`. Commit the changes
yourself. For trials, `--assets` and `--content` serve copies of `assets/slice`
and `content/`. A run with `--assets` but no `--content` cannot edit creature data.

## Creature clips

The **Creature** view edits the per-pose clips in `assets.json` (`clips`, keyed
`<form>.<pose>`) for each creature form, named from `content/pets.json` forms
when they carry `art`. Clip IDs, keys and the pose list (`creature_poses`) are
fixed; frames, durations and the loop flag are editable. The preview picks the
frame from elapsed time and draws it as the game does: the form profile's actor
scale, ground anchor at (233, 256) on the round 466 px panel. Reduced motion
starts it paused.

Saves change only the edited `clips` entries. Before writing, the studio runs
the served checkout's `tools/assets/build_slice.py` `load_assets()` on a scratch
copy. If the unedited manifest already fails (for example, a live paintover with
a custom colour), the clip rules are still checked and the save reports that
failure as a warning. Sprites with their own palette (`"palette": "axolotl"` or
an inline list) paint from that palette; ✎ and **Tidy outline** apply to the
shared palette only.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/clips` | Poses, clips, named palettes, forms, frame cap |
| `POST /api/clips` | `{"clips": [{"key", "frames", "durations_ms", "loop"}], "artist"}` |
| `GET /api/creatures` | `content/creatures.json`, its hash, validator limits, editability |
| `POST /api/creatures` | `{"data": <whole document>, "base": <hash>, "artist"}` |

## Behaviour and size

**Behaviour & size**, below the clip editor, edits `content/creatures.json` for
the selected form. The profile sets actor, icon and portrait scales; the page
shows each size against the panel and collection-cell limits. The behaviour
holds first-match-wins pose rules, a 900 ms idle beat schedule, and a quiet
cycle. **Simulate** applies the chosen conditions or idle to the panel preview.
The idle timeline plays the beats with their clips. Edits to a behaviour that
several forms share show a warning.

Saves replace the whole file, normalised to `json.dumps(indent=2)`. The page
sends the hash it loaded, so a save never overwrites unseen changes. The served
checkout's `tools/assets/creature_data.py` `load()` validates a scratch copy
first. Like `build_slice.py`, it comes from the checkout, not the image.

```sh
./scripts/uv run --python 3.12 tools/jelli-art/test_creatures.py
```

## Container

```sh
podman build -f tools/jelli-art/Containerfile -t jelli-art .     # or docker build
# Serve an existing checkout (read-only review):
podman run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 -v "$PWD:/work/jelligotchi:ro" jelli-art
```

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `JELLI_REPO` | Checkout path inside `/work` (default `/work/jelligotchi`) |
| `JELLI_GIT_URL` | Clone URL when the checkout is missing (public HTTPS by default) |
| `JELLI_BASE_BRANCH` | Branch a new studio branch starts from (default `main`) |
| `JELLI_STUDIO_BRANCH` | Commit every save to this branch; unset means no git writes |
| `JELLI_GIT_PUSH` | `1` pushes the studio branch in the background |
| `JELLI_PUSH_URL` | SSH push URL, for example `git@github.com:jrepp/jelligothci.git` |
| `JELLI_DEPLOY_KEY` | Private key path (default `/run/secrets/jelli-art-deploy-key`) |
| `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` | Commit identity (default `Jelli Art`) |

The container listens on 8765 and answers `GET /healthz`; `healthcheck.py` is
the probe. On start, the studio branch resets to the base branch once its art
has landed there, whether by merge or squash. Unmerged art is kept.

## Versioning and releases

Jelli Art has its own version (`VERSION`, tags `jelli-art-vX.Y.Z`); see ADR-011.
Release Please opens the release PR. When it merges,
`.github/workflows/jelli-art.yml` publishes `ghcr.io/jrepp/jelli-art` as `X.Y.Z`,
`X.Y`, `X`, and `sha-<commit>`.

## Hosting

`jelli-art.home.jrepp.com` on nuc, over Tailscale, is defined in t1-hosting
(memo-039, `jelli-art/` and `scripts/jelli-art-deploy`).
